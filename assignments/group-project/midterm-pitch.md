# Midterm Pitch

Refer to the [Group Project Description](PROJECT.md).

## Description

Identify and research a real-world business problem which may benefit from a relational database system solution. Reference various [business prompt examples](resources/group-project/examples) which have been provided to students in previous semesters. If your group experiences difficulty finding and describing a business problem, ask an instructor for help, or request to address one of the previously-provided prompts.

Describe how a database system can solve the business problem, and describe the objectives of such a system. Describe its information requirements in terms of inputs, outputs, and internal operations (e.g. updates and transactions).

Produce a logical database design that reflects the business problem and satisfies system objectives.

> Don't stress about perfecting your logical database design. Do the best you can. You will subsequently be assisted through the process of optimizing it using Normalization principles.

Present your work to the class and receive feedback.

### Presentation Requirements

Your presentation should include a business problem summary, a description of database system objectives and information requirements, and a preliminary ERD.

You may optionally include preliminary interface designs, report mock-ups, etc.
