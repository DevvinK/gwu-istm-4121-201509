# Group Project Final Implementation Deliverable

Refer to the [Group Project Description](/PROJECT.md).

## Description

Refer to the [system documentation deliverable](/final-documentation.md) which should describe your proposed system requirements and design.

Choose a [toolset](/resources/group-project/toolsets.md) based on system requirements, and implement your system design.

Implement a fully-functional database.

Implement at least a handful of important application functionality, including database-backed information input and output functionality.

### System Implementation Objectives

In accordance with the final system documentation, your final system should:

 + address the business problem
 + meet system objectives
 + perform at least a few information input tasks
 + produce at least a few information outputs
 + adhere to reasonable database design principles
 + contain a database full of appropriate data
 + be reasonably usable

## Submission Instructions

Upload your working database system to [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_6866128_1&course_id=_260328_1&assign_group_id=&mode=cpview).
 If implementing in MS Access, attach an compressed .mdb database file.
 Else if implementing with open source technologies, attach a compressed .sql database file.

If your implementation includes application software, attach a .zip file containing any relevant code repositories.

## Evaluation Methodology

Each database system implementation will be graded in terms of its demonstrated ability to address the system implementation objectives.
