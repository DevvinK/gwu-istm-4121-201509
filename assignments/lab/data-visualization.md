# Database Outputs (Data Vizualization) Lab Assignment

You may use any data visualization tool or software to complete this assignment.

If you would like to use Tableau software, obtain a product license from an instructor, and either activate the software on a classroom computer, or install and activate the software on your personal computer (recommended).

> Tableau's [data visualization software](http://www.tableau.com/data-visualization-software) is provided through the Tableau for Teaching program.

## Description

Import [this](https://github.com/gwu-business/open-data-library/tree/master/relational-data/evanston_healthscores) or [another](https://github.com/gwu-business/istm-4121/blob/master/notes/data-analysis.md#relational-datasets) real-world relational dataset into a DBMS, choosing appropriate indices and datatypes.

Investigate and analyze the data for the purpose of processing it into meaningful information. Write one or more SQL queries to produce dataset(s) which you can use to answer questions and tell stories.

Expand the database design, if helpful, by adding new tables and/or saving query results.


Focus on a single question to answer or story to tell based on the results of your querying.

Think of how to best convey that information in graphical form. Draw/sketch by hand visualization(s) which convey with clarity and accuracy the chosen information/message.

Ask other members of the learning community for feedback on your draft visualization.

Choose a visualization tool.

Either set up a direct connection between the visualization software and the database (recommended, to facilitate refreshable dashboards), or export database table(s) and/or database query results to a local .csv file and import that text file into the visualization software.

Replicate and expand-upon your infographic sketch using a digital data visualization tool.

Ask other members of the learning community for feedback on your final visualization.

Export the resulting chart(s) to a single .pdf file.

Suggested visual design elements:

  + title
  + legend
  + footer text box containing datasource identification and any methodology descriptions or chart clarifications/disambiguations as necessary

## Submission Instructions

Upload a .pdf file of one or more graphical data representations to [Blackboard](https://blackboard.gwu.edu/webapps/assignment/uploadAssignment?content_id=_6911618_1&course_id=_260328_1&assign_group_id=&mode=cpview).

## Evaluation Criteria

Full credit for a clear and concise data visualization(s) in appropriate display formats which convey multiple levels/layers of meaningful and accurate information/insights.

Else partial credit to highlight areas for improvement.

Else no credit.
