# Entity and Relationship Diagramming (ERD) Assignment

## Description

Reference this [example relational dataset](https://github.com/gwu-business/radio-data/tree/master/data) and choose one [example business prompt](/resources/group-project/examples/).

For each of these two examples:

 + list all entities and relationships
 + describe in English
    any relationships,
    desired/observed data characteristics,
    and business assumptions
 + sketch/draw by hand an ERD on paper or a whiteboard
 + leverage a digital diagramming tool of choice to convert your ERD to electronic form

### Expectations

Each of your two ERDs should:

 + communicate with clarity the logical and physical database design of the respective example
 + have a title
 + use proper terminology
 + represent all entities, and for each:
   + represent any known or likely attributes
 + represent all relationships between entities, and for each:
   + describe the relationship in English, for each direction
   + denote relationship cardinality, for each direction
   + optionally denote relationship optionality, for each direction
 + communicate stated assumptions in a text box footer as necessary
