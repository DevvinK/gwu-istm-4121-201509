# Entity and Relationship Diagramming (ERD) Assignment

## Description

Reference each of the following examples:
 + [sample relational dataset](https://github.com/gwu-business/radio-data/tree/master/data)
 + [sample business example](#todo)

For each example, list all entities and relationships.
  Describe in English
    the relationships,
    desired/observed data characteristics,
    and business assumptions.

For each example, sketch/draw by hand an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERDs) using a paper and pencil or whiteboard.

Finally, for each example, use a digital diagramming tool of choice
  to create a digital ERD.

Each of your two ERDs should properly model the entities and relationships given in the example.

State your assumptions as necessary in a text box to provide additional justification for your decisions.

## Submission Instructions

Upload two different ERD .pdf files to the same submission attempt via

## Evaluation Criteria

Full credit for employing proper ERD techniques (i.e. using the right shapes), including all entities and relationships in your diagram, choosing the right type of relationships in terms of optionality and cardinality, and stating assumptions as necessary.

Else no credit.
