# Relational Data Processing and Analysis Lab Assignment

Find a real world multi-table (relational) dataset which contains business-related data. Or choose one of the following pre-selected open datasets:

 + [Washington DC Transit Data](http://www.wmata.com/rider_tools/license_agreement.cfm) (agree and submit to reveal the data download)

Download the corresponding .csv or .txt file(s).

Import the data into a spreadsheet,
 if necessary and/or possible,
 to get a feel for dataset properties like number of rows (size), and
  number,
  name and
  nature of attributes.

Import the data into a database using the DBMS of your choice. Identify any existing relationships between the tables. Create indices as necessary to improve performance. Describe the dataset entities and relationships, including your reaction to and assessment of the logical dataset design.

Write SQL queries to ask questions of the data and process the data into information. Use the `JOIN` and `LEFT JOIN` clauses demonstrated in class, as well as other previously-demonstrated single-table clauses and functions.

Tell a story based on the knowledge you were able to acquire as a result of your data processing and analysis. Write 2-5 paragraphs in English describing what you learned. Embed or attach one or more queries to demonstrate mastery of a variety of clauses and functions, and to show how you processed the data and arrived at your conclusions.
