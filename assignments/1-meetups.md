# Meetups Assignment

Search [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) for data-related
 events in the Washington DC area.

Attend three events over the course of the semester.

At least two events must be hosted by different meetup groups.

Use caution when choosing a meetup to attend. If you're stuck or not sure where to start, try an event offered by one of the following recommended groups:

 + [Code for DC](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-DC/)
 + [Data Wranglers](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Wranglers-DC/)
 + [Washington Viz-ards](http://www.meetup.com/Washington-Viz-ards/)
 + [Open Data Leaders](http://www.meetup.com/Open-Data-Leaders/)
 + [MongoDB Users Group](http://www.meetup.com/Washington-DC-MongoDB-Users-Group/)
 + [Data Education](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Education-DC/)
 + [Tableau Data Nation](http://www.meetup.com/DC-Tableau-DATA-Nation/)
 + [Federal Big Data Working Group](http://www.meetup.com/Federal-Big-Data-Working-Group/)

 + [Data Community](http://www.meetup.com/Data-Community-DC/)
 + [Social Media Analytics](http://www.meetup.com/Social-Media-Analytics-DC/)

> Not all these groups have been previously vetted. Please edit this list based your own recommendations!

Write a short (2-3 page) summary of your experiences, to address the following questions:

 + Which events did you attend, which groups hosted them, and what happened at each?
 + What did you learn about contemporary data and database challenges and practices?
 + For each meetup group... Have you returned to attend subsequent events hosted by this group? Would you recommend the group to a friend? Why or why not?

You may attach or embed photos to your writeup to provide further evidence of event attendance.
