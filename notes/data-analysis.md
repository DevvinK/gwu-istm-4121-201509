# Data Analysis

## SQL

Like an English  sentence, each SQL query is comprised of one or more clauses.

### Clauses

Here are all the clauses available for use in a SQL query, in the order they are to be used:

```` sql
SELECT ...
FROM ...
JOIN ...
WHERE ...
GROUP BY ...
HAVING ...
ORDER BY ...
LIMIT ...
````

There is also a `UNION` clause used in special cases, but it is outside the scope of this course.

It is not necessary to use all, or even most, clauses in a SQL query.
