## Student Feedback

### Pros

#### Professor Knowledge

Some students expressed satisfaction with the professor's knowledge and abilities.

> Great pro(f)essor

> Keep up the good work!

> Technology expert.

> He his very knowledgeable ...

#### Professor Interactions

One student observed the benefits of personal interaction with the professor.

> Overall, I found you to be more helpful in a 1-on-1 environment, and I think I got a lot more out of private meetings than in class discussion.





### Mixed (Pro and Con)

#### Group Project

Some students expressed satisfaction with the hands-on nature of the group project but not necessarily the group-work nature of the the project.

> I liked the group project element, and I really enjoyed the class discussions and tackling design as a large group

> I'm sure I would have liked the group project as it interests me, however I found my group impossible to work with.

#### Lecture Engagement

Some students expressed dissatisfaction with the lectures.

> I would suggest finding a way to make the lectures more engaging.

> Lectures are good but can be a little more clear and concise.

> Some lectures were not very engaging and could have been more productive.

Another student expressed satisfaction.

> I liked the style of lecture and how the professor led the class during his lectures.





### Cons


#### Grading Criteria and Expectations

Some students expressed dissatisfaction with the clarity of grading criteria or expectations.

> Be more clear w/ assignment expectations

> Be more clear in your expectations and explanations for assignments and grading

> Things like "else 0" on a homework assignment for a slight error was ... too extreme.

> The course was a little bumpy at first, but smoothed out into a good routine. It would have been nice to start off with more clarity on the assignments

#### Schedule Adherence

Some students advocated for a rigid schedule with less flexibility (and in some cases more hand-holding). This includes week-to-week as well as in-class scheduling.

> Verbally communicat(e) when assignments are due

> ... when you started using clear agendas, it got better...on the other hand, you have to follow them.

> Please follow the schedule you set out

> The class plans were rarely ... followed in terms of time per activity, I think better budgeting of time would have been helpful.


#### More Hands-on Experiences

Some students advocated for more time spent in class on hands-on assignments.

> ... use more in-class time for lab component

> ... he would be more effective in teaching us if it were more hands on.

> we need to spend more time doing exercises in class...

> we need more tutorials and hands on practice with the content of this class

> Hope to see more example similar to the assignment to be illustrated in class.

> I feel like we should have taken more time to learn Access or other programs that would have helped us with the final project.

One student suggested lectures be pre-recorded to facilitate this desire.

> Record (lectures) so that (students) can (listen) outside class, use class time for labs and assistance.

#### Tools

Some students expressed difficulty using contemporary industry tools. Some observed a slight learning curve.

> Use blackboard instead of GitHub, as it is hard to navigate.

> Less info in github and more on blackboard. Since we are all already integrated with that software

> ... I found the class somewhat hard to follow/navigate at the beginning of the semester, such as githubs layout. As the semester went on and my knowledge increased, I found this class much more manageable

> I did not like the way GitHub was laid out. It was very difficult for me to know when assignments were due. I think using Blackboard would be much better and easier for students to navigate. I also don't think Slack was particularly helpful. In general, it's easier for students to use media that we have used before, so I think email is a more efficient medium for us.

> I don't think Github was a great tool. It was very challenging to locate items, and I think that using it increased to our confusion
