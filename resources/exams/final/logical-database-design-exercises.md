For each relation, design a relational database to store the data in an optimal way.
 Represent the design by drawing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) in the space provided.

Each ERD should:

  + Communicate with clarity the proper logical and physical database design
  + Represent all **entities**, and for each:
    + Represent any known or likely **attributes**, and denote which attributes are **primary keys**
  + Represent all direct **relationships** between entities, and for each:
    + Optionally describe the relationship in English, for each direction
    + Denote relationship **cardinality**, for each direction
    + Optionally denote relationship optionality, for each direction

State assumptions as necessary to justify answers.

You may make scratch-notes, but only ERDs will be considered for evaluation.
